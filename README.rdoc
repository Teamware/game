= Game
This is a proof of concept of doing game development using GWT.

Some of the things I want to test are:
* Rich model shared between server & client
* Realtime event distribution via websocket, all players see the same world
* Chatting
* World panning
* Realtime and shared editing the world even with people playing


= Installing
Deploy the war generated by the build.xml on a Jetty 7.3 server, that has support for
WebSocket.
